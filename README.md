On your first encounter, our app will inquire about your birth year and the number of days to your next deadline. These details are used to personalize your life progress bar and your deadline progress bar. These intimate details stay with you; we store them locally and won't ask again.

# Troubleshooting
- If the icon doesnt show correctly, try creating a shortcut of the .exe and using that instead
- If it doenst look correctly on the first try, that is a Windows issue with transparent GUIs. It can only happen on first start and it will never repeat. Restart the program.
- Copy & Paste the shortcut in the folder opened by running WinKey + R and "shell:startup". That will now open the proram at windows start.
